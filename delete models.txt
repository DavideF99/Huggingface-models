1. Remove all cached models: 

In order to delete models that have been downloaded and their respective weights we need to run the following in the terminal. 

~/.cache/huggingface/hub

rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub


2. Remove only specific models

Inside the cache folder, you’ll see directories named like:

models--facebook--blenderbot-400M-distill

We can delete just that folder:

rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--facebook--blenderbot-400M-distill


3. Clear transformer cache using the built-in API

Transformers has a built-in cleanup command:

transformers-cli cache --clear

Or the newer equivalent:

huggingface-cli cache delete

You can check what is cached:

huggingface-cli cache list

And delete a specific entry:

huggingface-cli cache delete <repo_id>
